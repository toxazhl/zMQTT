class PacketBuffer:
    """Accumulates incoming bytes and yields complete packets.

    TCP delivers bytes in arbitrary chunks — a packet may arrive across
    multiple reads, or multiple packets in a single read. Feed bytes as they
    arrive; iterate to consume all fully-received packets.

    Drain the iterator before feeding again. Iteration holds a ``memoryview``
    of the buffer so that consumed bytes are skipped rather than copied out,
    and a ``bytearray`` cannot be resized while a view on it is exported, so a
    ``feed`` mid-iteration raises ``BufferError``. Leaving the loop early is
    fine: closing the iterator releases the view.

    With *max_packet_size*, iteration raises ``PacketTooLargeError`` once the
    fixed header of an oversized packet has arrived.
